# File Manager

**compress & decompress**: _path_to_destination_ is the path to the directory

- you can enter absolute or relative path in any command provided for working with paths (all with the prefix _path_to_)

- if there are spaces in the names of folders or files, please wrap the entire path in double quotes

**_Good luck!_**
